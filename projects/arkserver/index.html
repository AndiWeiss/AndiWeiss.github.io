	<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			The survival game "ARK" has been given for free by Epic Games in June 2020.
			We started playing it - both local and on servers operated by friends of us.
			After two weeks of vacation without the possibility to play we where rather
			disappointed that a lot of things got lost during that time.
			We continued playing localy then - in this case the game stops as soon as
			the player exits. But that's not comparable to the multi player game.
		</p>
		<p>
			So we decided to bring up an ARK server locally on our home server.
			This ARK server, so the intention, shall be started when we want to play
			and stopped when the last of us stops playing. We don't want to have it
			public in the internet, a local server is fine for us.
		</p>
		<p>
			So this page shows how to set up the ARK server on an Ubuntu based machine.
			To have the administration easy I am using the ark manager.

	<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
		<p>
			Before doing the game server installation there are some preconditions
			to fulfill.
		</p>

		<h2 id="preconditions">Preconditions</h2>
			<p>
				First thing is setting upe the regular Ubuntu installation as you want
				to get it.
			</p>
			<p>
				After that the system requires some additional packages,
				all coming out of the official Ubuntu resources:
<pre>
sudo apt install curl libc6-i386 lib32gcc1 libsdl2-2.0-0:i386 steamcmd
</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Next thing to do is the cration of the user which shall run the
				ARK server. I call it <code>steam</code>. My decission is to give this
				user the uid 10000. The following commands have to be executed with an
				acoount having sudo rights.
<pre>
sudo adduser --uid 10000 steam
</pre>
				Answer the questions of this command to give all details you want to provide.
			</p>
			<p>
				This new user requires sudo abilities
<pre>
sudo usermod -aG sudo steam
</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now the steam client has to be installed. This is also included in the
				standard Ubuntu resources.
<pre>
sudo apt install steamcmd
</pre>
				The steam license has to be agreed during this installation.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the last thing to do with the regular account. The following part
				has to be done with the user <code>steam</code>, so either log off and
				log in as steam or do <code>su steam</code> and <code>cd ~</code>.
			</p>

		<h2 id="arkmanager">Install the ARK manager</h2>
			<p>
				First we do an update of the steam client and check if it works fine.
<pre>
steamcmd
&lt;wait for the prompt "Steam&gt;"&gt;
login anonymous
&lt;there should be no error and no warning&gt;
quit
</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we do the installation of ARK manager. I want to start the
				game server manually, so I use
<pre>
curl -sL https://git.io/arkmanager | sudo bash -s steam
</pre>
				If the game server shall be started together with the machine
				you have to use
<pre>
curl -sL https://git.io/arkmanager | sudo bash -s steam --install-service
</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				The ARK manager requires some settings to be able to run on
				an Ubuntu system. Edit the file <code>/etc/arkmanager/arkmanager.cfg</code>
				and change the tag as explained here:
				<ul>
					<li><code>steamcmdroot="/usr/games"</code></li>
					<li><code>steamcmdexec="steamcmd"</code></li>
					<li><code>steamcmd_appinfocache="/home/steam/.steam/appcache/appinfo.vdf"</code></li>
					<li><code>steamcmd_workshoplog="/home/steam/.steam/logs/workshop_log.txt"</code></li>
				</ul>
				Add the lines:
				<ul>
					<li><code>arkflag_crossplay=true</code></li>
					<li><code>arkflag_NoBattlEye=true</code></li>
				</ul>
				The first line allows connecting with an Epic Game account.
				The second line disables the BattleEye feature.
				This has to be done if neither your server is
				a machine with direct internetconnection nor your router
				routing table is adapted to ARK needs. I don't explain
				the routing config here because we want to have the game server
				only in our home network.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now the game server requires your local configuration.
				Edit the file <code>/etc/arkmanager/instances/main.cfg</code>
				and adapt these tags to your wishes.
				<ul>
					<li><code>ark_SessionName</code></li>
					<li><code>serverMap</code></li>
					<li><code>ark_ServerPassword</code></li>
					<li><code>ark_ServerAdminPassword</code></li>
					<li><code>ark_MaxPlayers</code></li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h2 id="gs_inst">Install the ARK server</h2>
			<p>
				Now we're ready for the game server installation.<br/>
				Be patient! This may take <em>LONG</em>!
<pre>
arkmanager install
</pre>
			</p>

	<h1 id="config">Configure the server</h1>
		<p>
			We prefer playing the server in a way that no player can
			harm another player. Therefore we want to configure the server
			to PvE and disable "friendly fire".
		</p>
		<p>
			To configure the server to PvE edit the file
			<code>ARK/ShooterGame/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/GameUserSettings.ini</code>
			and add <code>serverPVE=True</code>
			to the section
			<code>[ServerSettings]</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			With this you can't harm players of different teams. But you
			can still harm players of your own team.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don't want that edit the file
			<code>ARK/ShooterGame/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/Game.ini</code>.
			Add the config tag
			<code>bPvEDisableFriendlyFire=True</code>
			to the section
			<code>[/script/shootergame.shootergamemode]</code>.
			In the default installation this file is empty. So in that case
			you have to write the following lines into the file:
<pre>
[/script/shootergame.shootergamemode]
bPvEDisableFriendlyFire=True
</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			Other configuration possibilites can be found in various
			pages in the internet :-)
		</p>

	<h1 id="admin">Administrate the server</h1>
		<p>
			After having the game server installed there are some commands
			to supervise the game. Here I show the most important once.
		</p>

		<h2 id="am_start">arkmanager start</h2>
			<p>
				Use this command to start the server.
				<em>The server is not directly usable!</em>
				It takes several minutes until the server can be used.
				If it is accessable can be detected with <code>arkmanager status</code>.
			</p>

		<h2 id="am_status">arkmanager status</h2>
			<p>
				This command shows the status of the ark server.
				As long as the server is not accessable it will print
<pre>
Running command 'status' for instance 'main'
 Server running:   Yes 
 Server PID:   99315 
 Server listening:   No 
 Server build ID:   6011539 
 Server version:   320.38 
</pre>
				The values vary dependent on your system - even with each start
			</p>
			<p>
				This is an example when the server is accessable:
<pre>
Running command 'status' for instance 'main'
 Server running:   Yes 
 Server PID:   99315 
 Server listening:   Yes 
Server Name: XxXxXxX - (v320.38)
Steam Players: 0 / 70
Active Steam Players: 0
 Server online:   Yes 
 ARKServers link:   http://arkservers.net/server/111.222.33.44:27015 
 Steam connect link:   steam://connect/111.222.33.44:27015 
Active Players: 0
 Server build ID:   6011539 
 Server version:   320.38 
</pre>
				The IP addresses are the addresses of the server as they
				are seen from the internet.<br/>
				So in the case your machine is
				directly connected you'll see the IP of your machine,
				otherwise you'll see the IP your router received.
			</p>

		<h2 id="am_stop">arkmanager stop</h2>
			<p>
				Use this command to stop the server.
				The server saves the actual game during shutdown.
			</p>

	<h1 id="next_steps">Next steps</h1>
		<p>
			Next goal for my personal ARK server is to add it to the automatic
			shut down mechanism. That means that the automatic shut down
			- or better - suspend shall only be done if there's no player
			connected to the server.
