	<h1>home server based on Ubuntu 20.04 with ZFS</h1>
	<p>
		I am running a home server since many years.
		Somewhere around 2018 I deciced to switch to a new server
		using ZFS as filesystem. At that time I started with a
		combination of several howtos I found in the internet. That
		was a lot of work and I have no chance to list all of the
		sources as each of them only solved one step of the whole
		story.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, beginning with Ubuntu 20.04, Canonical added
		(experimental) support of Ubuntu installation on ZFS. Therefore
		I decided to do a clean new installation of my server.
		Additionally I decided to create a documentation of each step I
		do - maybe it is usefull for other people, too
	</p>

	<p>
		So just feel free to follow my steps.
	</p>

	<h2>Preconditions</h2>
	<p>
		I don't want to use new hardware, but I have available:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Mainboard: ASROCK B85M-ITX</li>
		<li>Pentium G3440T</li>
		<li>128G SSD for booting</li>
		<li>4 harddisks as raid for data</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I personally prefer xubuntu, so I also need a bootable xubuntu
		20.04 USB stick.
	</p>

	<h3>work in progress</h3>
	<p>
		The mainboard provides four SATA ports and an ESATA port. My
		actually running server has the SSD connected to the ESATA port.
		In the future I want to free the ESATA port again. Therefore
		I have two possibilities:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>use an already available USB3 to SATA converter</li>
		<li>buy a PCIE SATA controller</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I do the actual tries with the USB3 adapter - just because I
		have it available. Up to now I face no differnce between having
		the	SSD connected to SATA or to USB - the installation process
		is the same.
	</p>

	<p>
		Actually I'm setting up the new environment so the whole thing
		is work in progress.
	</p>

	<h3>Things to know</h3>
	<p>Just to point it out:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			I know that having the boot data not on the redundant
			system leads to non accessable data in the case the boot
			device fails or gets corrupted. But I prefer having a fast
			boot process and in the situation of a failing device I
			have to do a desaster recovery of the boot device.
		</li>
		<li>
			I also know that booting from USB is not as relaiable than
			booting	from a SATA device. It may happen that I buy a PCIE
			SATA adapter to solve this issue.
		</li>
		<li>
			Additionally I also know that the used mainboard doesn't
			support ECC RAM and therefore is not as reliable as a
			professional server. But hey, this is a home server,
			not a professional one.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			In normal case the server shall be off. I don't like current
			consumption when it is not in use.
		</li>
		<li>
			On request it shall be available FAST. So I want to use
			suspend to RAM.
		</li>
		<li>
			On power fail everything shall work smooth, so suspend to
			RAM is not enough - the shutdown has to do a disk image,
			too.
		</li>
		<li>
			The system has to provide Wake On Lan - I don't want to
			push the button.
		</li>
		<li>
			The supension shall be done automatically after some
			minutes of idletime
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Already known issues</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			(solved) during ubuntu 20.04 installation there is no
			possibility to define the partition layout or to create
			data pools with redundancy
		</li>
		<li>
			(solved) the mainboard is equipped with a Qualcomm Atheros
			AR8171 gigabit ethernet chip. This chip supports Wake On
			Lan, but you have to tweak the linux system to enable it
		</li>
		<li>
			(solved) the ubuntu partitioning when using the
			installation on ZFS creates a 2G swap partition. This is
			not large enough for suspend to disk
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Creating the USB boot medium</h2>
	<p>
		I propose to use <a href="www.ventoy.net">Ventoy</a>. It's
		available for Linux and Windows.<br/>
		This page explains the usage of ventoy under linux.<br/>
		Usage under Windows is explained on the website.<br/>
		The configuration of the stick content is identical.
	</p>

	<h3>Download ventoy</h3>
	<p>
		Download the tool here:<br/>
		<a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases">Ventoy download from Github</a><br/>
		You'll get a file "ventoy-x.y.z-linux.tar.gz" with x, y, and z
		digits for the version.
	</p>
	<p>
		Optional: check the SHA256 against the value given on the
		website.<br/>
		<code>sha256sum ventoy-x.y.z-linux.tar.gz</code><br/>
		and compare the value.<br/>
		don't forget to use the <em>real</em> filename
	</p>
	<p>
		Extract the file with the command<br/>
		<code>tar -xaf ventoy-x.y.z-linux.tar.gz</code><br/>
		don't forget to use the <em>real</em> filename
	</p>

	<h3>Create bootable USB stick</h3>
	<p>
		cd into the extracted directory<br/>
		<code>cd ventoy-x.y.z</code><br/>
		don't forget to use the <em>real</em> directory name
	</p>
	<p>
		Insert an USB stick with enough space for the ubuntu iso file
		plus a file for persistent data. I recommend to use a stick
		with at least 8GB.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		run ventroy with the command<br/>
		<code>sudo sh Ventoy2Disk.sh -I /dev/XXX</code><br/>
		Replace XXX by the device name of your USB stick.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your computer will remount the stick and show one partition
		named<br/>
		<code>ventoy</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Copy your ubuntu iso file on this USB stick.<br/>
		Now the stick is bootable, but we need the possibility to
		modify files on the stick persistent.
	</p>

	<h3>Create persistent data area on the stick</h3>
	<p>
		ventoy contains a plugin for persistent data creation on
		bootable USB sticks. To prapare this execute the command<br/>
		<code>sudo sh CreatePersistentImg.sh -s 1024 -t ext4 -l casper-rw</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		This creates a file <code>persistence.dat</code> in your actual
		directory.<br/>
		Copy the file on the stick.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now we have to tell ventoy to use this persistence file for
		booting ubuntu.<br/>
		To do so create a directory <code>ventoy</code>
		on the USB stick.
	</p>
	<p>
		Create a file <code>ventoy.json</code> in this directory.<br/>
		Content of this file has to be:
	</p>
	<pre>
{
    "persistence": [
        {
            "image": "/xubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso",
            "backend": "/persistence.dat",
            "autosel": 1
        }
    ]
}
	</pre>
	<p>
		You can adapt the file names to your needs. It's also possible
		to rename <code>persistence.dat</code>, in that case use the
		new filename in <code>ventoy.json</code>, too.
	</p>

	<h3>Preparing the partitioning script on the boot medium</h3>
	<p>
		As mentioned above the default partitioning script of the
		ubuntu installation medium creates a swap partition of 2G.
		If the system shall do suspend to disk the swap partition is
		used to store the complete RAM content. Knowing this leads to
		the conclusion that 2G is - in most case - much to small.
	</p>
	<p>
		As solution I first do a modification on the USB stick. The
		stick creation process explained above leads to a persistent
		storage in that boot system. So I boot the live stick and
		change the required file. Since then this modified file is used
		for partitioning.
	</p>
	<p>
		After booting your future server system from the USB stick
		with "Try without installation" edit the file<br/>
		<code>/usr/share/ubiquity/zsys-setup</code><br/>
		with root rights. If you are familar with vi you can use<br/>
		<code>sudo vi x/upper/usr/share/ubiquity/zsys-setup</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		In this file you'll find the lines<br/>
		<code># Convert to MiB to align the size on the size of a block</code><br/>
		<code>SWAPVOLSIZE=$(( SWAPSIZE / 1024 / 1024 ))</code><br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		This value is handed over to the format subroutine. It is a
		value in MB (1024 * 1024 byte). Instead of using the more or
		less hard coded value based on <code>SWAPSIZE</code> I change
		that to the size of the RAM on the board + 1GB.
	</p>
	<p>
		So exchange the lines by<br/>
		<code># get RAM size</code><br/>
		<code>SWAPVOLSIZE=$(cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal: | sed -n 's|^[^:]*:\W*\([0-9]*\).*|\1|p')</code><br/>
		<code># do alignent to one more GB</code><br/>
		<code>SWAPVOLSIZE=$(( (($SWAPVOLSIZE / 1024) + 1023 + 1024) & 0xffffc00 ))</code><br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		After saving this change the stick is prepared for installation.
		You can start the installation either with a new boot or without
		rebooting by using the install ubuntu button.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you regulary work in Linux it's easy to have a look on that
		file on another linux machine. After saving that file in the
		life system shut down the life system and connect the USB stick
		to your working linux system. In a default environment your
		system will mount the stick under <code>/media/&lt;user&gt;/ventoy</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		create a directory for temporary mount of the persitence file<br/>
		<code>mkdir pers</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now mount the persistence file<br/>
		<code>sudo mount /dev/media/&lt;user&gt;/ventoy/persistence.dat</code><br/>
		In the case that you have chosen a different filename use that one.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you have access to your modified zsys-setup. You find it in<br/>
		<code>pers/upper/usr/share/ubiquity/zsys-setup</code>
	</p>

	<h2>Starting the installation</h2>
	<p>
		I recommend to do the installation with only the boot drive
		connected. After the installation the regular ZFS mechanisms
		can be used very easily to create a raid data pool and move
		the little amount of initial data on that new created pool.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the Window "Installation type" you have to chose "Advanced
		Features ...". In the now opened window select "EXPERIMENTAL:
		Erase disk and use ZFS"
	</p>
	<p>
		Now let the installer do its work. After that you'll have an
		ubuntu system on one hard disk using ZFS wherever it is
		possible. There's only one partition with another file system.
		The EFI partition must not be converted to ZFS. this one has
		to stay on VFAT.
